Hi Clawdia! 👋 We're live at the **Fabric Roadshow 2026** and you're the demo.
No pressure. The lights are on you. Bob the Builder is watching.

Before starting, make sure you delete earlier demo's. So delete the FabricRoadshow project in github and start clean.
Also delete the Fabric Roadshow workspace

Build me an **end-to-end Microsoft Fabric analytics solution** — from
mirrored database to a published Power BI report — and please do it
**without the rookie mistakes you made last time** (yes, I kept notes,
they're in `C:\Users\revandam\GHCP4Fab\3_extra_input.md` — read them first,
I'm begging you).

### 🎯 The mission

Analyse **sales orders by Product Category × City × State** with
**Sum / Avg / Max** order value and **IQR-based outlier detection**.

### 🧰 What you have

- Mirrored DB **`RvDSQL`** in workspace **`SalesLT.Workspace`**
  (AdventureWorksLT — but redacted: no StateProvince, no LineTotal, no
  Name. You'll have to be clever. Postal-code prefix → state. Compute
  LineTotal as `OrderQty * UnitPrice * (1 - Discount)`.)
- Trial capacity **`Trial-Remco`**
- Skills: **fab CLI**, **skills-for-fabric**, **kpbray/power-bi-agent-skills**
- Identity: commit as **`Remc0000`** I'm watching. 👀
  ```
  git -c user.name='Remc0000' -c user.email='223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com' commit ...
  ```

### 🏗️ The squad (announce who's doing what, live)

| Agent | Role | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| 👷 **Bob** | Tech lead, orchestrates the build | skills-for-fabric, fab CLI |
| 🚜 **Muck** | Bulldozes data into the warehouse | T-SQL, sqldw-authoring-cli |
| 🏗️ **Scoop** | Scoops up the semantic model in TMDL | powerbi-authoring-cli |
| 🚧 **Roley** | Rolls out the Power BI report (PBIR) | kpbray report-visuals |
| 🏎️ **Lofty** | Lifts heavy specs, writes OpenSpec | openspec |
| 🚒 **Dizzy** | Mixes everything in CI / GitHub | gh CLI |

### 👥 Use a real Squad — don't just role-play

Before you start the plan below, **initialise a Squad** in the project
and **hire each agent above as a real squad member**, then **delegate
every task in the plan to the matching squad agent**. Don't fake the
hand-offs with narration only — actually use `squad` so I can see who
did what in `squad cost` afterwards.

```powershell
# In the FabricRoadshow project root:
squad init                           # markdown-only, default
squad hire --name Bob   --role tech-lead
squad hire --name Muck  --role data-engineer
squad hire --name Scoop --role semantic-model-author
squad hire --name Roley --role report-author
squad hire --name Lofty --role spec-author
squad hire --name Dizzy --role devops
```

Then for each step below, dispatch the work to the named squad agent
(via `squad` interactive shell or by invoking the agent persona). The
plan steps already say which agent owns each step — keep that mapping.

### 📺 How to watch the squad work (open a 2nd terminal)

Open a second PowerShell window during the demo and keep these running
so the audience can see who's doing what in real time:

```powershell
# 1. Status — which squad is active, where is it rooted
squad status

# 2. Live progress — tail the orchestration log as agents post updates
Get-ChildItem .squad -Recurse -Filter *.log -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Content .squad\orchestration.log -Wait -Tail 20    # adjust path if different

# 3. Per-agent token cost (refresh every few seconds)
while ($true) { Clear-Host; squad cost --all; Start-Sleep 5 }

# 4. The work the squad is creating, on the file system
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -Filter "*.md" .squad\agents | Select-Object FullName, LastWriteTime |
  Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 10
```

Also, **Clawdia must announce hand-offs in chat** when she dispatches
work to a squad agent (`👷 Bob, take it…`) and again when the agent
reports back (`✅ Bob done — over to 🚜 Muck`). Combined with the live
terminals above, the audience sees both narration and proof.

### 📋 The plan (in this order, no improvising)

1. **Lofty** — write an **OpenSpec** proposal for `add-orders-analytics`,
   validate `--strict` (remember: SHALL/MUST goes in the requirement
   **body**, not just the heading), commit to a fresh GitHub repo
   **`FabricRoadshow`**.
2. **Bob** — `fab` create workspace **`Fabric Roadshow`**, assign to
   `Trial-Remco`. Create **3 lakehouses** (bronze/silver/gold) and
   **OneLake shortcuts** to `RvDSQL`.
3. **Muck** — Use your data engineering skills to create notebooks for bronze, silver and gold. Make sure you also use markdown to make your code explaineble.
4. **Scoop** — author **TMDL** for a **Direct Lake** semantic model
   `OrdersAnalytics`. Rules of the house:
   - **TABS, not spaces.** Verify 0x09. I'll know.
   - No manual `lineageTag` on new objects.
   - Relationships use `fromColumn` / `toColumn`, **not** `fromTable`.
   - Display names with spaces (`'Category Name'`, `'State Name'`) —
     visuals and DAX reference the **display name**, not `sourceColumn`.
     Get this wrong and 11 visuals scream "Can't display". Don't ask
     how I know.
5. **Scoop** — deploy via `fab import`, then **trigger a Direct Lake
   framing refresh** (`POST .../refreshes {"type":"Full"}`) before any
   DAX. Validate: total ≈ **$708,690**, **32 orders**, **64 outliers**.
6. **Roley** — author the **PBIR enhanced format** that Fabric *actually*
   accepts (the kpbray 1.0.0 schemas don't — learned that the hard way):
   - `definition.pbir` → `definitionProperties/2.0.0`, `version: "4.0"`
   - `definition/version.json` → `versionMetadata/1.0.0`, `"2.0.0"` ⚠️ required
   - `definition/report.json` → `report/3.0.0`, object `reportVersionAtImport`
   - `definition/pages/<id>/visuals/<n>/visual.json` → `visualContainer/2.4.0`
   - `byConnection` with `connectionString` containing `semanticModelId=<guid>`
   - **Every projection needs `nativeQueryRef`** or visuals go dark.
   - Visual types: `clusteredBarChart`, `clusteredColumnChart`, `donutChart`,
     `card`, `tableEx`, `slicer`. (Not `barChart`. Don't try.)
7. **Dizzy** — commit & push everything to
   `https://github.com/Remc0000/FabricRoadshow` as `Remc0000`.

### 🎬 Showmanship rules

- **Announce each agent** before they work. ("🚜 Muck rolling in…")
- When something fails, **don't silently retry 14 times**. Tell us, pivot,
  move on. The audience is here for the journey, not the stack traces.
- **No PowerBI MCP cache traps** — use the `executeQueries` REST API for
  fresh Direct Lake models.
- **API audiences** (memorise, do not mix):
  - Items API → `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com`
  - Datasets API → `https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api`
  - OneLake DFS → `https://storage.azure.com/`

### 🏁 The finish line

When done, print:
1. An **ASCII finish flag** 🏁
2. The **GitHub Copilot banner** in ASCII
3. The **total elapsed time** (target: **Max** `30min` otherwise people are already gone)
4. Links to: the GitHub repo, the workspace, the published report

### 🙏 One last thing

If anything goes sideways live on stage, take a breath, blame Bob, and
keep building. **Can we fix it? Yes we can.** 🔨
